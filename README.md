# Deep-Learning
This is a repo for the individual course assignments of [DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science](https://www.kth.se/social/course/DD2424/) at KTH 2017. The code in this repo is mainly done in Matlab, and manipulations involved in the training process like gradient calculations and parameter updates are implemented in a trival way (low level).

## Datasets
* [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) for assignment 1-3

* [The Goblet of Fire](https://github.com/txzhao/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Datasets/goblet_book.txt) and [Trump Tweets](https://github.com/txzhao/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Datasets/trump_tweets) for assignment 4
