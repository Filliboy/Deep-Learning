# Deep-Learning
This is a repo for the individual course assignments of DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science. The code in this repo is mainly done in Matlab, and manipulations involved in training like gradient calculations and parameter updates are implemented in a relatively low level.

## Datasets
* [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) for assignment 1-3

* [The Goblet of Fire](https://github.com/txzhao/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Datasets/goblet_book.txt) and [Trump Tweets](https://github.com/txzhao/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Datasets/trump_tweets) for assignment 4

## Contents
* Assignment 1: one-layer network with multiple-class outputs (test accuracy: 40.42%) 

* Assignment 2: two-layer network with multiple-class outputs (test accuracy: 54.06%)

* Assignment 3: k-layer network with multiple-class outputs (test accuracy: 54.8%)

* Assignment 4: vanilla RNN to synthesize English text character by character
